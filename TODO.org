* CANCELED from throns import set_dbspl

It's useful to have basic operation/import without the thorns library.

As long as `from thorns import set_dbspl` in cochlea.__init__ would be
the only reference to throns, I prefer to have this little function
duplicated.
* DONE Merge Jörg's PR: typecasting in pyx
